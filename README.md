## How to BRUTE-FORCE a Hash function
### *Md. Abrar Jahin*

To be a good Hash Function H(x), where y is the Hash value:
1. H must be efficient to compute
2. H must be deterministic
3. y must be random looking
4. H must be resistant to forgery
   * It should be very time consuming to find collisions
   * y should depend in every bit of the origin
